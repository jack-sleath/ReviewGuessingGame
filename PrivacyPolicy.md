# Privacy Policy – Guessing Game for Letterboxd

**Last updated:** 23 November 2025  

## 1. Overview

This browser extension ("Extension") adds a movie guessing game on top of Letterboxd list pages. It works entirely in your browser and does not collect, store, or sell your personal data.

This Extension is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Letterboxd.

## 2. Data the Extension accesses

The Extension only accesses:

- The current Letterboxd list page you have open  
- The linked film pages and their public review content on `letterboxd.com`

This information is used solely to:

- Detect which films are in the list  
- Fetch public review text for those films  
- Generate quiz questions locally in your browser

## 3. Data collection, storage, and sharing

The Extension:

- Does not collect personal data (such as your name, email, account info, or browsing history outside Letterboxd list pages).  
- Does not send any data to external servers controlled by the developer or third parties.  
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools.  
- Does not share any data with advertisers or other third parties.

All game logic runs locally in your browser. Any state (such as your current score or question queue) is kept in memory and is not uploaded anywhere.

## 4. Cookies and local storage

The Extension:

- Does not set its own cookies.  
- Does not store data in localStorage or sync storage for tracking or profiling.  

It relies only on normal browser requests to `letterboxd.com` which may use Letterboxd’s own cookies as part of their service.

## 5. Changes to this policy

If the Extension’s functionality changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated and a new version will be published along with the updated extension.

## 6. Contact
